For this project I wanted to showcase many different skills and more specifically have something to specific and accessible to reference for interviews. 
Part 1: 
Launched a Virtual Machine (VM) in Google Compute Engine (GCE) using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
On that VM run a game that I developed in C++ using the SFML Library
                   *** I made this game for an assignment while obtaining my Computer Science (CS) degree

Part 2:
Created a Django Application ran locally
